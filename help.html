        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            This is the Timesheet Management Help Documentation. This is a program designed to help enter and keep track
            of
            time and hours for employees. You can enter in times, send them for approval, and look at reports of your
            own
            hours if you are a standard user. Admins can approve hours, put in their own, and generate reports for
            people to
            view their hours. Although robust as it was, several improvements have been made to different areas of the
            program that will be highlighted in the <a href="#features">Features and Usage</a> section of the
            Documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of these improvements is to provide a better user experience and increase the robustness of the
            program. The goal here is to make an in-house program that can reliably keep track of hours and and provide
            an
            easy experience for each targeted user.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="started">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            There is quite a bit to go into regarding all of the pieces of the software, but this will give a quick
            overview of the different pieces of the software so that either role can get started. The users can be
            broken down into two separate groups: Managers and Employees. However, the first thing either user needs
            to do when starting the program is to log in. You will have an employee id and a password. If you don't,
            feel free to speak to someone and ask for it.
        </p>

        <h3>Employees</h3>
        <p>
            Employees have the primary task of entering in and submitting the hours that they work on a project or
            section. That can be done in the Time Entry Screen. Follow the form, and then submit. The entry will be
            recorded below and you can then submit the entry for approval by going to the Approval Header and pressing
            submit for approval. Select the ones you want to submit and send them away. They will be reviewed by the
            manager and either approved or rejected. More on all of this in the <a href="#features">Features and
                Usage</a> section of the Documentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Managers</h3>
        <p>
            Managers might have all of the responsibilities of the employees mentioned above (submitting times for
            approval), but they also have the responsibility of approving or rejecting hours (which can be done in the
            approval screen), generating reports (which can be done in the Run Reports screen), and user/project
            management (which can be done in Admin Tools). There's a lot that goes in to the last 2 responsibilities,
            but for approving time entries, open the approval screen, select the entries you want to approve, and give
            them a thumbs up (approve the entries). Use the same process for rejecting, but give them a thumbs down and
            give them a collective reason why (this can be used one entry at a time for more specific messages). For
            more information, please see the <a href="#features">Features and Usage</a> section of the Documentation.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="features">
        <h2>Features And Usage</h2>
        <p>
            This is where all of the nitty gritty gets laid out. This will be broken down to address each feature (not
            user type). So, if you'd like a quick break down of the responsibilities of each type of user meant for this
            application, see the <a href="#started">Getting Started</a> section of the Documentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Login Screen</h3>
        <div class="grid-container grid-2">
            <div>
                <p>
                    The login screen (as seen to the right) is a basic screen used to access the application. It
                    features 2
                    fields: <i>User ID</i> and <i>Password</i>. These are given to you as you cannot register yourself
                    for
                    the
                    application. If you do not have credentials and are told you need to be using the software, get in
                    touch
                    with someone so they can get the account set up and get your user id and password to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One other big portion of the login screen is the connectionstring. This is accessed with File >
                    Change
                    Connection String. The connection string is the name of the computer or server that the database is
                    being
                    stored on. For the most part, this will never need to change, and if it does, then communication
                    should
                    go
                    out as far as what the new connection string should be.
                </p>

                    <dd>This error means that the service managing the database is not currently running. Odds are, if
                        you
                        are
                        seeing this, other people are too. However, this could also be because the computer is unable to
                        connect
                        to the database/the connection string is incorrect. You might need to change the connection
                        string.

                    The main screen is where all of the submenus pop out from. Depending on your level of program
                    access, certain menus will be unavailable to you. For example, the administrator tools is not
                    available to each person.
